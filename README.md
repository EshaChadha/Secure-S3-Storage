# Secure-S3-Storage
A CLI based tool which combines the use of encryption and steganography to securely store user data inside S3 .
It will help the user with encryption of data before uploading it to the cloud. The information for decryption is emailed to the user. In addition to encryption, this tool also uses a method called steganography to hide the encrypted text in an image file. This tool works on the S3 service on the AWS Platform.

This tool also contains a mode to check the security controls of your S3 environment and notifies the user if any misconfiguration is found out.
